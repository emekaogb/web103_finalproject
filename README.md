## About

### Description and Purpose

Community Resource Finder is a web application that helps people easily find important local services like food banks, homeless shelters, free/lost-cost clinics, mental health support, job training centers, community events, after-school programs, immigration/legal aid, and more. 

### Inspiration

Accessing critical resources can be challenging, especially for those facing financial hardship and other unique circumstances. Information is often scattered across multiple websites or difficult to navigate. A centralized finder with a user-friendly interface would theoretically simplify the process of discovering and accessing these local services.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Typescript

Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL

Authentication: BetterAuth

External APIs: Google Maps Embed, Google Places

## Features

### ✅ Lists all local resources

One page that lists all the local resources in the area, paginated and displayed via cards.

### ✅ Resource details page
